Don't let their size fool you, Great Danes make great indoor companions, even if you live in an apartment.  Yes, I said even in an apartment!  A Great Dane puppy would rather go for a quick walk with you and then spend the day lounging next to you on the couch, than spend all of their hours outdoors.  In fact, their low fat bodies actually make them incompatible with extreme hot or cold temperatures, they really were made to be your companions.
